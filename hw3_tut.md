1. What is one major advantage of using an object instead of multiple variables?

Using objects allows you to replicate various groupings of shapes very quickly while maintaining individual editability of each group. As a graphic designer this is something that I am super excited to know about.

2. What is the role of the parameters of a function?

The parameters of the function defined what will be the editable variables. 

3. What does it mean for a function to "return" something?

To convert something from one thing back to another.
